# Implementation Plan

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to implement the core functionality of the persuasion intelligence tool for ghostwriting agencies. Each step should be marked as `Done` once completed. Do not skip steps. Follow the order strictly.

---

## Step 1: Set Up Project Structure

- Create a Flask-based backend.
- Set up the file and folder structure for:
  - `app/` for backend logic
  - `templates/` for frontend HTML (if any)
  - `static/` for styles/scripts (if needed)
  - `models/` for simulation and scoring logic
  - `data/` for sample user feedback and training data
- Initialize Python environment with requirements file.

**Status:** Done

---

## Step 2: Implement Input Parser Module

- Accept text input via an API endpoint.
- Extract key metadata:
  - Word count
  - Sentence count
  - Estimated tone (using NLTK or simple heuristics)
  - Keyword and hashtag frequency
  - CTA and link detection
- Return a structured JSON with parsed features.

**Status:** Done

---

## Step 3: Implement Persuasion Scoring Module

- Analyze parsed text using heuristics based on copywriting frameworks:
  - Clarity
  - Urgency
  - Social Proof
  - CTA Strength
- Assign qualitative scores to each category (1–10 scale).
- Return composite "Influence Score."

**Status:** Done

---

## Step 4: Build Simulation Engine

- Create personas based on sales funnel archetypes (e.g., Unaware, Problem-Aware, Solution-Aware).
- For each persona, define response likelihood curves based on persuasion features.
- Run Monte Carlo simulations (e.g., 1,000 iterations per persona).
- Output simulated response likelihoods per persona.

**Status:** Done

---

## Step 5: Integrate Sentiment & Tone Analysis

- Use NLTK or similar NLP library to score sentiment (positive, neutral, negative).
- Align sentiment score with persuasion tone output to assess resonance accuracy.

**Status:** Done

---

## Step 6: Create Output Metrics Endpoint

- Aggregate all scores and simulation outputs.
- Format into a clean JSON response.
- Include:
  - Influence Score
  - Simulation persona breakdown
  - Persuasion category scores
  - Sentiment alignment notes

**Status:** Done

---

## Step 7: Implement Feedback Loop Endpoint

- Accept user-submitted campaign data (e.g., impressions, conversions, revenue).
- Use regression to slightly adjust simulation weights and scoring sensitivities.
- Store anonymized feedback samples in `data/`.

**Status:** Done

---

## Step 8: Build Web Interface (MVP)

- Simple Flask + HTML/CSS interface
- Upload/paste content → run analysis → view output
- Form to submit feedback manually

**Status:** Done

---

## Step 9: Secure Access & NDA Lockdown

- Implemented User model with invite code verification
- Added token-based session management
- Created login, signup, and NDA agreement pages
- Protected all routes with authentication middleware
- Added invite-only access control

**Status:** Done

---

## Step 10: Internal Dogfooding & Testing

- Connect to internal ghostwriting workflows
- Run 10+ real tests with client content
- Log predictions vs. performance
- Refine modules based on results

**Status:** Not Started

---

## Step 11: Package for Licensing

- Containerize the app using Docker
- Add usage metering or licensing keys
- Prepare PDF one-pager for onboarding new ghostwriters

**Status:** Not Started
